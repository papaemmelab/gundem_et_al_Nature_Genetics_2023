# gundem_et_al_Nature_Genetics_2023
This repo contains the additional scripts used to create the main, extended and supplementary figures for Gundem et al. Nature Genetics 2023. Scripts are named according to the figures that they generate. All scripts source "util_dataset.R" that loads the information about the tumor samples and patients as well as the mutation calls from WGS and MSK-IMPACT analyses and finally plots the relevant figure.
